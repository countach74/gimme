Version 0.1.4 of gimme. 

Changes:

 - Reworked Request and Response objects to not be so tightly coupled,
   allowing for easier testing.

 - The above change has consequences for how controller methods should be
   created. Request and response objects are now passed to controller methods,
   instead of being accessed via controller attributes. 

 - Controllers are now instantiated once, upon being added to an application
   via route definition.
